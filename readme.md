# Learning Repository

## What This Is
This is my personal repository for learning different technologies. I add code, examples, and projects as I learn them.

## Current Contents
- **websocket-app** - WebSocket implementation with React frontend and Node.js backend
- **typescript** - TypeScript practice problems and solutions  
- **kafka** - Initial Kafka setup and configurations
- **gitignore** - Git ignore file for projects
- **fileCreater.py** - Python script for creating files

## Status
- Working on WebSocket application
- Practicing TypeScript problems  
- Setting up Kafka for message streaming
- Planning to learn more technologies

## Usage
Each folder contains separate projects/examples for that technology. You can explore them individually.

## Note
This is an active learning repository. More content will be added as I learn new technologies.
